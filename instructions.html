<h1>Set Instructions</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
The objective of the game is to find a "set" of 3 cards from the cards on the table as quickly as possible. There are a total of 81 cards in a Set deck, and throughout most of the game, at least 12 of these cards will be displayed on the table. The only exceptions to this rule are when there is no "set" on the table, in which case 3 cards will be added to the table until a "set" is created, or if there are no more cards left in the stock (cards that have yet to be used.) In order for the game to end, two conditions must be met:
<ol>
<li>There are no more cards left in the stock.</li>
<li>There are no more "sets" left on the table.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Set Cards</h3>
<p>
A set card has four properties with three types each:
<ol>
<li>Color: red, green, purple</li>
<li>Fill: solid, striped, outlined</li>
<li>Shape: diamond, oval, squiggle<li>
<li>Number: 1, 2, 3</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Definition of a "Set"</h3>
<p>
A "set" is a matching of 3 cards such that for each individual property, the cards are all the same or all different. Another way to think about it is, a matching of 3 cards is NOT a "set" if for any property, two of the cards are the same but the remaining card is different.
